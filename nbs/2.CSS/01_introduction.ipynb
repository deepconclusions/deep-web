    "## What is CSS? \n",
    "\n",
    "**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML. CSS separates the content of a webpage from its visual presentation, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design aspects of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites for learning CSS include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic HTML**: Since CSS is used to style HTML elements, having a basic understanding of HTML is necessary.\n",
    "2. **Web Development Concepts**: Familiarity with web development concepts and terminology will be helpful in understanding CSS principles and practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasons for using CSS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**: CSS separates the structure (HTML) of a webpage from its presentation (CSS), making code easier to maintain and update.\n",
    "2. **Consistency**: It allows developers to apply consistent styling across multiple pages of a website or different websites.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: CSS provides precise control over the appearance of individual elements on a webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, etc.\n",
    "4. **Accessibility**: Enhances the accessibility of web content by allowing developers to specify properties such as text size, contrast, and layout, making websites more usable for people with disabilities.\n",
    "5. **Responsive Design**: CSS plays a crucial role in creating responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example CSS code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* Resetting default styles and setting a base font */\n",
    "body {\n",
    "  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n",
    "  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */\n",
    "  margin: 0; /* Remove default margins */\n",
    "  padding: 0; /* Remove default padding */\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Styling heading elements */\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  color: #333; /* Dark gray color for headings */\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Styling paragraph elements */\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  color: #666; /* Light gray color for paragraphs */\n",
    "  line-height: 1.5; /* Set line height for better readability */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Styles related to the `body` element are grouped together, including resetting default styles and setting a base font and background color.\n",
    "- Styles for heading elements (`h1`) are grouped together, setting the color.\n",
    "- Styles for paragraph elements (`p`) are grouped together, setting the color and line height."
