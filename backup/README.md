## Learn Programming For Data Science

- Programming for Data Science is a subject we’ve designed to explore
  the various programming components of data science.
- You’ll learn programming techniques to do Data Science stuff like data
  manipulation, analysis, visualization, machine learning.

This subject has been split into specific courses as below. The duration
is the average of what our older students have taken, but can be longer
or shorter for different types of students:

- [Fundamentals of Programming (Python)(1 month)
  <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle" title="Get Started"></i>](./Python/00_outline.ipynb)
- [Data Analysis with Python
  <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle" title="Get Started"></i> (2
  months)](./Python-Data-Analysis/outline.ipynb)
- [Machine Learning (1 month)
  <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle" title="Get Started"></i>](./Python-Data-Analysis/Week4-ML-Intro/41_overview_of_machine_learning.ipynb)
- [Deep Learning with Pytorch (3-5 months)
  <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle" title="Get Started"></i>](./Pytorch/pytorch_outline.ipynb)
- Database Management with SQL and Python (optional) (1 month)
- [Web Development with Django (optional) (2-6 months)
  <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle" title="Get Started"></i>](https://web.deepconclusions.com)

This subject can be taken as a whole or you can take specific parts of
strong interest or application to you and your field. But if you’re a
complete beginner, we advise you take the whole subject.

Here is how our subject is offered:

- Duration: (Depends on the course units you have chosen)
- Sessions: Four times a week (one on one)
- Timing: Evenings or/and weekends
- Location: Online or/and at UMF House, Sir Apollo Kagwa Road

If you’re serious about learning Programming and getting prepared for
Data Science and Web Development roles, I highly encourage you to enroll
in our programming courses.

Don’t waste your time following disconnected, outdated tutorials. We can
teach you all that you need to kickstart your career.
