        "## CSS Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS syntax follows a simple structure consisting of selectors and declaration blocks. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Selectors\n",
        "These are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. You can select elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  h1 {\n",
        "    color: blue;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  In this example, `h1` is the selector, targeting all `<h1>` elements, and `color: blue;` is a declaration block that sets the text color of those elements to blue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Declaration Blocks\n",
        "These are enclosed within curly braces `{}` and contain one or more declarations separated by semicolons `;`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  selector {\n",
        "    property1: value1;\n",
        "    property2: value2;\n",
        "    /* more properties */\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each declaration consists of a property and its corresponding value, separated by a colon `:`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## CSS Selectors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Selectors are fundamental to CSS as they allow you to target specific HTML elements for styling. Here are some common types of selectors:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Element Selector \n",
        "Targets elements by their tag name.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  p {\n",
        "    font-size: 16px;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This selector targets all `<p>` elements and sets their font size to 16 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Class Selector\n",
        "Targets elements with a specific class attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  .highlight {\n",
        "    background-color: yellow;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This selector targets all elements with the class \"highlight\" and gives them a yellow background color.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ID Selector\n",
        "Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  #header {\n",
        "    font-size: 24px;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This selector targets the element with the ID \"header\" and sets its font size to 24 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Descendant Selector\n",
        "Targets elements that are descendants of another element.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  div p {\n",
        "    font-style: italic;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This selector targets all `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements and sets their font style to italic.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Child Selector\n",
        "Targets elements that are direct children of another element.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  ul > li {\n",
        "    list-style-type: square;\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  This selector targets all `<li>` elements that are direct children of `<ul>` elements and sets their list style type to square.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Grouping Selectors\n",
        "Sometimes multiple CSS rulesets may have similar declarations. Take a look at the example below:\n",
        "\n",
        "```css\n",
        "h1 {\n",
        "  font-family: Times New Roman;\n",
        "  color: green;\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "h1 {\n",
        "  font-family: Times New Roman;\n",
        "  color: green;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Looks inefficient right? Instead of repeating the same declarations we can simply have a group of selectors in a CSS ruleset.\n",
        "\n",
        "A group of selectors consists of selectors separated by commas\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```css\n",
        "h1, p {\n",
        "  font-family: Times New Roman;\n",
        "  color: green;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## CSS Comments:\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS comments allow you to add explanatory notes within your stylesheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Single-line Comments\n",
        "Begin with `/*` and end with `*/` and extend to the end of the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
        "  /* This is a single-line comment */ \n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-line Comments\n",
        "Also enclosed within `/* */`, allowing comments to span multiple lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```css\n",
